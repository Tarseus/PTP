This weight, `adaptive_weight`, smoothly ranges from 0 to 1, focusing the model's attention on pairs with a cost difference that is significantly above the batch average, while de-emphasizing pairs that are too similar (low signal) or already well-separated.\n- It also inherits the fundamental Bradley-Terry / logistic loss structure, which aims to maximize `logp(winner) - logp(loser)`. Instead of using `softplus`, this child uses the mathematically equivalent `logsigmoid` formulation `logsigmoid(delta_logp - margin)`, which is often more numerically stable.\n\nNew Coupling Ideas:\n1.  **Rank-Gapped Margin**: A new margin calculation is introduced. Instead of being directly proportional to `delta_cost`, the margin is determined by the *rank* of `delta_cost` within the batch. The `rank_gap` function maps the cost differences to a uniform distribution over `[0, 1]`, and this is then scaled by a hyperparameter `gamma`. This makes the margin robust to outliers in the cost distribution and ensures that the model is incentivized to separate pairs based on their relative cost importance, not their absolute cost gap. This prevents pairs with extremely large cost differences from dominating the loss landscape.\n2.  **Modulated Logistic Loss**: The final loss is a direct product of the adaptive weight and the rank-gapped logistic loss term.

The goal is to create a more robust loss that focuses on 'hard' examples where the model's preference is incorrect, while still being sensitive to the relative importance of preference pairs.\n\nInherited Ideas:\n- From Parent 0 (Rank-Gapped Tanh-Modulated Logistic Loss), it inherits the idea of a **rank-based margin**. The margin that the model must overcome is not proportional to the absolute cost difference but to its rank within the batch. This prevents outliers with large cost gaps from dominating the loss and makes the objective focus on the relative ordering of preferences.\n- From both Parent 0 and Parent 1, it inherits the use of a **tanh-based adaptive weight** on the z-scored cost difference. This weight (`adaptive_weight`) smoothly emphasizes pairs with an above-average cost difference, effectively focusing the training on more significant preference pairs while down-weighting pairs that are either too similar (low signal) or already well-separated.\n\nNew Coupling Ideas:\n1.  **Hinge Loss Core**: The core loss is changed from the logistic/softplus form of the parents to a hinge loss (`relu(margin - delta_logp)`). This creates a 'max-margin' objective. The loss is zero for 'easy' pairs where the log probability gap (`delta_logp`) already exceeds the rank-based margin, allowing the model to focus its capacity exclusively on 'hard' or 'misclassified' pairs where `delta_logp < margin`. This can lead to faster convergence on difficult examples.\n2.  **Modulation of Hinge Loss**: The final loss is a direct product of the inherited `adaptive_weight` and the new hinge loss core. This coupling ensures that the learning signal is only applied to pairs that are both misclassified (non-zero hinge loss) and considered important by the adaptive weighting scheme (high tanh weight). This synergy prevents the model from wasting effort on trivial misclassifications (e.g., pairs with very small cost differences that happen to fall just below the margin).", "hyperparams": {"beta": 1.0, "gamma": 1.5, "eps": 1e-08}, "operators_used": ["relu", "tanh", "zscore", "rank_gap"]}}, "better_than_baseline": false}

For pairs with a `delta_cost` significantly above the mean, the margin grows very rapidly, creating a strong learning signal to push `delta_logp` much higher.\n2.  **Synergy of Rank Weight and Exponential Margin**: The final loss is the product of the rank-based weight and the exponential-margin loss. This coupling creates a powerful dynamic. A pair only receives a large loss if it has *both* a high relative rank (large `rank_weight`) and a large absolute cost difference (leading to a large exponential `margin` that is hard to overcome). A pair with a high rank but small z-score will have a high weight but a small margin, resulting in a moderate loss. Conversely, a pair with a large z-score but low rank (e.g., in a batch of all high-gap pairs) will face a large margin but its contribution will be down-weighted. This focuses the model's capacity on the most unambiguously important preference pairs.", "hyperparams": {"beta": 1.0, "eps": 1e-08}, "operators_used": ["logsigmoid", "exp", "zscore", "rank_gap"]}}, "better_than_baseline": true}

This `hybrid_weight = rank_gap(delta_cost) * sigmoid(zscore(delta_cost))` ensures that the loss focuses on pairs that are both relatively important within the batch's sorted order (high rank) AND have a cost difference that is statistically significant (high z-score).

This creates a much steeper gradient as `delta_logp` approaches the margin from below, strongly penalizing the model for being close to violating the preference margin.

It focuses learning on pairs where the model's preference is misaligned with the cost-based ground truth, while being robust to the scale and distribution of costs and log-probabilities within a batch.\n\nInherited Ideas:\n- From Parent 0 (Adaptive Rank-Weighted Saturated Logistic Loss), it inherits the idea of using a rank-based weight, `rank_gap(delta_cost)`.

The margin is `gamma * tanh(zscore(delta_logp))`. This is a significant departure from typical preference losses that base the margin on `delta_cost`. By basing the margin on the model's current confidence (`delta_logp`), the loss becomes adaptive to the model's own output distribution. When the model is very confident (large `delta_logp`), the `tanh` saturates, preventing excessively large gradients. When the model is uncertain (small `delta_logp`), the margin is small, providing a gentle learning signal. This stabilizes training, especially when log-probabilities fluctuate wildly.\n2. **Gated Rank-Weighted Loss**: The final loss couples the rank-based weight from Parent 0 with the sigmoid-based gate from Parent 1. The loss for each instance is `sigmoid(zscore(delta_cost)) * rank_weight * softplus(...)`. This creates a two-stage filter: the `rank_weight` up-weights pairs with a large relative cost gap, and the `sigmoid` gate smoothly down-weights or 'turns off' pairs whose cost gap is not statistically significant within the batch. This dual-factor weighting ensures that the model only receives strong signals from pairs that are both relatively and statistically important, enhancing stability and focus.", "hyperparams": {"gamma": 1.0, "eps": 1e-08}, "operators_used": ["softplus", "sigmoid", "tanh", "zscore", "rank_gap"]}}, "better_than_baseline": true}

The gate is computed as `sigmoid(alpha * (rank_gap(delta_cost) - beta))`. This creates a smooth, step-like function that activates the loss primarily for pairs whose cost-difference rank is above a certain threshold (`beta`). The `alpha` parameter controls the steepness of this activation, allowing for a soft or hard transition. This focuses learning on the top fraction of most important pairs in the batch, as determined by their rank, while gracefully down-weighting less significant pairs.\n2.  **Log-Probability Difference Clipping**: A stability trick is introduced by clipping the log-probability difference `delta_logp` within a symmetric range `[-clip_value, clip_value]`. This prevents extremely confident but incorrect model predictions from generating excessively large gradients, which can destabilize training. It helps to regularize the model's confidence and ensures a more stable learning process, especially early in training or when encountering noisy data.", "hyperparams": {"gamma": 1.5, "alpha": 10.0, "beta": 0.5, "clip_value": 5.0, "eps": 1e-08}, "operators_used": ["softplus", "tanh", "sigmoid", "zscore", "rank_gap", "clamp"]}}, "better_than_baseline": false}

The goal is to produce a loss that is robust to variations in the scale and distribution of costs within a batch, while focusing learning on pairs where the model's preference is misaligned with the cost-based ground truth.\n\nInherited Ideas:\n- From Parent 1 (Adaptive Rank-Weighted Saturated Logistic Loss), it inherits the idea of a saturated, z-score-normalized margin: `margin = gamma * tanh(zscore(delta_cost))`. This creates a margin that is robust to the absolute scale of costs (due to z-scoring) and is stabilized against extreme outliers by the `tanh` saturation.\n- From both parents, it inherits the use of `rank_gap(delta_cost)` to create a `rank_weight`. This ensures that pairs with a higher relative cost difference within the batch contribute more significantly to the gradient, focusing on the most important preference signals.\n\nNew Coupling Ideas:\n1.  **Rank-Modulated Sigmoid Loss**: Instead of using the rank as a simple linear weight on the loss, it is used to modulate the argument of a `logsigmoid` function. The core loss is `-logsigmoid(rank_weight * (delta_logp - margin))`. This couples the rank and the core preference signal in a non-linear way. For high-rank pairs (large cost gaps), the `rank_weight` is close to 1, and the loss behaves like a standard logistic loss. For low-rank pairs, the `rank_weight` scales down the argument, effectively softening the loss boundary and reducing the penalty for small preference misalignments. This provides a smoother gradient profile than simple linear weighting.\n2.  **Adaptive Temperature Scaling**: The z-scored cost difference is used to compute an adaptive temperature `T = exp(-zscore(delta_cost))`. This temperature scales the entire loss term. For pairs with a cost difference significantly above the batch mean (`zscore > 0`), the temperature `T` becomes small (`< 1`), which amplifies the loss and encourages the model to learn these important preferences more strongly. Conversely, for pairs with a below-average cost difference (`zscore < 0`), the temperature `T` becomes large (`> 1`), which dampens the loss and reduces the learning signal, preventing the model from overfitting to noisy or insignificant pairs.

Instead of using `rank_gap` to directly weight the loss or construct a margin, it is used as the input to a `tanh` function. The resulting `tanh(rank_gap(delta_cost))` term acts as a smooth, bounded gate on the entire loss. For pairs with low rank (small cost difference), the gate is near zero, effectively ignoring them.

This makes the target preference gap (`delta_logp`) adaptive to the batch's statistics (mean and standard deviation). A larger `delta_cost` relative to the batch average demands a larger `delta_logp` from the model. This is different from the parents, which coupled `rank_gap` or `tanh(zscore)` into the margin.

The primary goal is to focus learning on misaligned preferences (where `logp(a) - logp(b)` is low) while being robust to the scale and distribution of costs within a batch and preventing outlier pairs from dominating.\n\nInherited Ideas:\n- From Parent 0 (Sigmoid-Gated Rank-Weighted Logistic Loss), it inherits the idea of a `sigmoid(zscore(delta_cost))` gate. This acts as a smooth, adaptive filter, gracefully de-emphasizing pairs with cost differences that are below the batch average, thereby focusing on the most statistically significant preference signals.\n- From Parent 1 (Adaptive Rank-Weighted Saturated Logistic Loss), it inherits the idea of a saturated margin, specifically `tanh(zscore(delta_cost))`. This makes the target preference margin robust to the absolute scale of costs and prevents extreme outlier pairs from creating an unbounded, potentially destabilizing margin.\n\nNew Coupling Ideas:\n1. **Rank-Adaptive Margin Scaling**: A new margin is constructed by coupling the saturated z-score cost with a rank-based scaling factor. The margin is `gamma * rank_gap(delta_cost) * tanh(zscore(delta_cost))`. This unique coupling ensures that the margin is not only bounded and normalized (from `tanh(zscore)`) but also directly proportional to the relative importance of the pair within the batch (from `rank_gap`). A pair with a high cost difference relative to its batch peers will have both a high rank-gap and a high tanh value, resulting in a strong, well-defined margin. Conversely, a pair with a low relative cost difference will have its margin gracefully shrink towards zero.\n2. **Log-Sigmoid Core Loss**: Instead of the standard `softplus` logistic loss, this child uses a `logsigmoid` formulation: `logsigmoid(delta_logp - margin)`. This is mathematically equivalent to `-softplus(margin - delta_logp)` but can offer better numerical stability, especially when the argument `margin - delta_logp` becomes very large. This change ensures the core loss calculation is robust while maintaining the same underlying logistic objective.", "hyperparams": {"gamma": 2.0, "eps": 1e-08}, "operators_used": ["logsigmoid", "sigmoid", "tanh", "zscore", "rank_gap"]}}, "better_than_baseline": true}

The objective is to intelligently focus learning on misaligned preferences while being robust to the scale and distribution of costs within a batch.\n\nInherited Ideas:\n- From Parent 0 (Sigmoid-Gated Rank-Weighted Logistic Loss), it inherits the idea of using a sigmoid-based gate, `sigmoid(zscore(delta_cost))`, to weight the final loss. This smoothly emphasizes pairs with a cost difference that is statistically significant (above average) within the batch context.\n- From Parent 1 (Adaptive Rank-Weighted Saturated Logistic Loss), it inherits the use of `tanh(zscore(delta_cost))` to create a saturated, batch-normalized margin. This prevents outlier pairs from creating an unbounded margin, leading to greater numerical stability.\n\nNew Coupling Ideas:\n1. **Rank-Saturated Margin**: A new margin is constructed by coupling the rank of the cost difference with the saturated z-score. The margin is `gamma * rank_gap(delta_cost) * tanh(zscore(delta_cost))`. This creates a dynamic margin that is large for pairs that are both high-rank (relatively important) and have a large z-score (statistically significant cost gap). It gracefully reduces the margin for pairs that might have a high rank but a small z-score (e.g., in a batch with low cost variance), or vice-versa.\n2. **Clamped Logistic Loss Core**: The core loss is computed as `softplus(clamp(margin - delta_logp, min=min_val))`. This stability trick prevents the argument to `softplus` from becoming excessively large and positive, which can happen if the model's `delta_logp` is a large negative number (very wrong prediction). By clamping the value, we prevent potential gradient explosion from extremely mispredicted pairs, improving training stability without affecting the gradient for most pairs.", "hyperparams": {"gamma": 2.0, "min_val": -5.0, "eps": 1e-08}, "operators_used": ["softplus", "sigmoid", "tanh", "zscore", "rank_gap", "clamp"]}}, "better_than_baseline": true}
