This loss combines the stable logistic loss framework from `AdaptiveMarginLogTanhLoss` with the cost-sensitive margin concept from `AdaptiveContrastiveMarginLoss`. It inherits the use of z-scoring to create a batch-adaptive margin from the former, and the idea of a margin that grows with the cost gap from the latter.\n\nInherited ideas:\n- From `AdaptiveMarginLogTanhLoss`: The core loss structure is `-logsigmoid(delta - margin)`, and it uses `zscore` on the cost gap to create a batch-adaptive signal.\n- From `AdaptiveContrastiveMarginLoss`: The margin is directly proportional to the cost information, creating a cost-sensitive target for the log-probability difference.\n\nNew coupling ideas:\n1.  **Clipped Z-Score Scaling**: Instead of normalizing the cost gap by the winner's cost (which can be unstable for small costs), this loss uses a clipped z-score of the cost gap. `torch.clamp(ops.zscore(cost_gap), min=0)` ensures the margin is always non-negative and prevents pairs with very small cost gaps from generating a negative margin (which would flip the preference signal). It also avoids the tanh squashing, allowing the margin to grow more linearly with significant cost differences.\n2.  **Margin Damping**: A `margin_damping` hyperparameter is introduced. The final margin is calculated as `beta * torch.log1p(clipped_zscored_gap * margin_damping)`.

This is a softer, non-clipping alternative to the `clamp` used in Parent 2.

From `StableTanhBetaLoss`, it inherits the use of `softplus` to guarantee the final scaling factor (`beta`) is strictly non-negative, which is a robust stability trick.

This loss function integrates the stable, bounded cost-scaling from both parents with a confidence-based gating mechanism. It inherits the core Bradley-Terry structure (`-logsigmoid`), the use of `zscore` on both log-probability differences and cost gaps, and the `tanh` activation on the normalized cost gap from both `StableTanhBetaLoss` and `AdaptiveTanhBetaLoss`. This provides a robust, bounded signal for how much the cost difference should influence the loss.\n\nNew Coupling 1: Instead of using `softplus` or a simple linear transform on the tanh signal, this child introduces a sigmoid-based gate. The gate is computed as `sigmoid(tanh_cost_signal + bias)`, making it a non-linear, smooth switch that modulates the learning signal. When the cost gap is large and positive, the gate approaches 1, applying full pressure. When the gap is near zero or negative (data noise), the gate approaches `sigmoid(bias)`, reducing the learning signal and preventing overfitting to ambiguous pairs.\n\nNew Coupling 2: The final scaled delta is a weighted average between the raw `zscored_delta` and the cost-gated `zscored_delta`. The weight `alpha` controls this interpolation. This allows the model to always have a baseline learning signal (`alpha * zscored_delta`) while adding a cost-sensitive component `(1-alpha) * gated_signal * zscored_delta`. This hybrid approach provides stability, ensuring that even pairs with small cost gaps contribute to learning, while still emphasizing pairs with clear preferences.", "hyperparams": {"alpha": 0.2, "gate_bias": -1.0}, "operators_used": ["logsigmoid", "zscore", "tanh", "sigmoid"]}, "novelty": 589.1297468583007}, "better_than_baseline": false, "novelty": 589.1297468583007, "diversity_descriptor": {"behavior": [0.7535640001296997, 609.538330078125, 0.7103593945503235, 0.00016021728515625, 0.7231144309043884, 308.3634033203125, 0.6970658898353577, -76.3279037475586, 0.6931471824645996, -0.0091552734375, 0.6931471824645996, 0.00830078125, 0.6931471824645996, 0.008056640625, 0.6931471824645996, 0.019775390625, 0.6931471824645996, 0.027587890625], "ops": ["logsigmoid", "zscore", "tanh", "sigmoid"], "hyperparams": ["alpha", "gate_bias"], "signature": "code:bfa6e88321f6794ce3478022cdedb7abea99ca2b"}}
