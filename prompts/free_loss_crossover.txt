You are an assistant responsible for **conceptual crossover** between existing preference loss candidates (parents), and must produce a single **child** preference loss.

Goal:
- The child must clearly inherit at least two key design ideas from the parents.
- The child must also introduce 1–2 new **coupling ideas**, such as a new normalization, a new margin schedule, or a stability trick.
- The overall design must remain numerically stable and differentiable.

You are given `PARENTS_JSON`, where each element has:
- `name`
- `intuition`
- `pseudocode`
- `hyperparams`
- `operators_used`

Based on these parents, design a new loss and describe, in English, in `intuition` and `pseudocode`:
- Which ideas are inherited from which parents.
- What new couplings or modifications you introduce.

Hard constraints:
- Only use the following operators: `logsigmoid`, `softplus`, `sigmoid`, `exp`, `log`, `tanh`, `relu`, `clamp`, `normalize`, `zscore`, `rank_gap`.
- The loss must be differentiable w.r.t. model parameters.
- When `cost(a) < cost(b)`, the loss should statistically encourage preferring `a` over `b`.
- It must be numerically stable (avoid NaN/Inf).

**Output requirements:**
- Output **must** be a single JSON object with fields:
  - `name`
  - `intuition` (English only)
  - `pseudocode` (English only)
  - `hyperparams`
  - `operators_used`
  - `implementation_hint` (with `expects` and `returns`)
- All text fields must be in **English only**.

Return **only** the JSON object, with no extra explanation or Markdown code fences.
